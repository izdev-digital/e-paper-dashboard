# izBoard Firmware

## Overview

ESP32 firmware for the izBoard E-Paper dashboard device. Connects to an izBoard server, fetches rendered dashboard images on a configurable schedule, displays them on a 7.5" E-Paper screen, and deep-sleeps between updates to maximize battery life.

## Hardware

- **ESP32 Board**: [Waveshare E-Paper ESP32 Driver Board](https://www.waveshare.com/e-Paper-ESP32-Driver-Board.htm)
- **E-Paper Display**: [Waveshare 7.5inch e-Paper HAT (B)](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_e-Paper_HAT_(B)_Manual) — 800×480, black/white/red

> **Note**: Other E-Paper displays or ESP32 boards can be supported with pin configuration and display driver adjustments.

## Features

- Scheduled dashboard image updates from the server
- Deep sleep between updates for long battery life
- Secure device pairing via captive portal
- OTA firmware updates
- Manual refresh and factory reset via reset button

## Setup

### First Boot

1. Power on the ESP32 board
2. The device shows a QR code for its password-protected `izBoard-XXXX` Wi-Fi access point and a six-character claim code
3. Scan the QR once and use the captive portal to enter the home Wi-Fi credentials and the server's `CLIENT_URL`
4. Reconnect the phone or laptop to its normal network, open the server's Devices page, and enter the claim code shown on the display
5. The device stays on home Wi-Fi, receives its credential, and begins fetching dashboards without rebooting

The claim code expires after ten minutes. Wi-Fi, server, and pending claim details are saved before the device leaves setup mode, so an interrupted device can resume the claim after power is restored.

HTTPS server certificates are checked against the trusted root bundle in `data/cert/x509_crt_bundle.bin`. Replace and regenerate that bundle when a deployment uses a private certificate authority. The device must be able to obtain network time before its first verified HTTPS connection.

### Device Controls

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Manual refresh | Press the reset button once |
| Factory reset | Hold the reset button for 10 seconds |
